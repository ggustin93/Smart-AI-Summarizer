# Top 8 Ways to Supercharge Webflow Site Performance

Enhance your Webflow site's performance with these proven strategies to ensure optimal speed and user experience.

## 1. Avoid Third-Party Scripts
Third-party scripts, chatbots, and tracking scripts can significantly slow down your site. Prevent them from loading immediately to improve initial load times without affecting user experience.

## 2. Delay Scripts with Google Tag Manager
Use Google Tag Manager to manage and delay the loading of tags and scripts, optimizing your site's performance by up to 6 seconds after the initial page load.

## 3. Selective Loading on Mobile vs. Desktop
Load fewer scripts on mobile versions of your site to improve speed, as Google ranks sites based on their mobile performance.

## 4. Optimize and Compress Images
Compress images using tools like Image Compressor and convert them to WebP format to reduce file sizes without compromising quality.

## 5. Lazy Load Images
Implement lazy loading to defer the loading of images until they are needed, enhancing page load times and user experience.

## 6. Use SVGs
SVG images are smaller and maintain high quality. Optimize SVGs by standardizing their size and compressing them to reduce code complexity.

## 7. Reduce or Remove Fonts
Minimize the number of fonts and weights used on your site. Consider using system-UI fonts to eliminate additional server requests and improve load times.

## 8. Avoid Preloads
Preloading pages can slow down your site by loading multiple pages simultaneously. Disable preloading to maximize performance.

## Testing and Monitoring
Regularly test your site's performance using tools like Pingdom, PageSpeed Insights, and GTmetrix to ensure changes positively impact load times and user experience.

By following these strategies, you can maintain and enhance your Webflow site's performance, ensuring a fast, efficient, and user-friendly experience.
