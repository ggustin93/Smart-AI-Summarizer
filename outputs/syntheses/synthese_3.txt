# Ultimate Guide to Webflow Site Performance Optimization

## Introduction
Maximizing your Webflow site performance is crucial for delivering a fast and responsive user experience. This guide provides essential tips to enhance your site's speed and efficiency.

## Measuring Speed and Performance
Google's Lighthouse tool measures and reports on key performance metrics:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**
- **Speed Index (SI)**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**

Each metric has a specific weight, with TBT being the most significant.

## Webflow Default Optimization Features
Webflow offers several built-in optimization features:
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
- **HTML/CSS/JS code minification**
- **Responsive images with `srcset`**
- **Static page generation for CMS items**
- **Lazy loading of images**

## Third-Party Scripts Optimization
Third-party scripts can significantly impact performance. Recommendations include:
- Adding scripts only to necessary pages.
- Keeping global scripts in the footer.
- Testing new scripts for performance impact.
- Using `defer` or `async` attributes.
- Delaying non-critical scripts with `setTimeout`.
- Loading scripts conditionally.
- Using `preconnect` or `dns-prefetch` for required origins.

## Fonts
Fonts are critical but can be optimized:
- Minimize the number of fonts.
- Upload fonts manually with `swap`.
- Preload fonts with code.

## Images
Images are often the heaviest assets:
- Compress images and use WebP format.
- Set images below the first screen to lazy load.
- Avoid using images as backgrounds.
- Use SVGs where applicable and embed small SVGs directly.

## Video
Webflow's native video handling can be suboptimal:
- Avoid using native Video elements.
- Prefer embedding YouTube/Vimeo iframes.

## Site Organization
Organizing your site efficiently can improve performance:
- Regularly clean up in the Style Manager.
- Set styles at the root level.
- Disable unused features.
- Preload critical links.
