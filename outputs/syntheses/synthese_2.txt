# Performance Optimization Features for Faster Webflow Sites

## Overview
Webflow has introduced several new features to enhance site performance, ensuring faster load times and a smoother user experience. Below are the key updates:

### 1. Lazy Loading for Images
- **Default Setting**: New images are set to lazy load by default, meaning they load only when they appear on the screen.
- **Customization**: This setting can be overridden for individual images if needed.
- **Scope**: Applies to inline images (`<img>` elements), not background images.

### 2. Advanced Font Loading Options
- **Font-Display Property**: Set to "swap" to prevent flashes of invisible text, ensuring content is displayed immediately using a preloaded system font.
- **Customization**: Available for custom fonts added to Webflow, not for Google or Adobe fonts.

### 3. Link Preloading
- **Prefetching**: Downloads linked page assets as soon as the current page is fully loaded.
- **Prerendering**: Fully renders and downloads all necessary assets for a linked page before it is opened, ideal for main links like call-to-actions.
- **Customization**: Three preloading options available in the settings panel for links.
