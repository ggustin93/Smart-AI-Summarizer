# Ultimate Guide to Webflow Site Performance Optimization

## Introduction
Maximizing your Webflow site performance is crucial for providing a fast and responsive user experience. This guide covers essential tips and techniques to optimize your Webflow site effectively.

## Measuring Speed and Performance
Google's Lighthouse tool measures and reports on key performance metrics:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**
- **Speed Index (SI)**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**

Each metric has a specific weight, influencing the overall performance score.

## Webflow Default Optimization Features
Webflow includes several built-in optimization features:
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Delivers site assets globally.
- **Code Minification**: Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Responsive Images**: Automatically resize images for different screen sizes.
- **Static Pages for CMS Items**: Generates and stores static pages.
- **Lazy Loading**: Default lazy loading for images.

## Third-Party Scripts Optimization
Third-party scripts can significantly impact site performance. Follow these best practices:
- Add scripts only to necessary pages.
- Keep global footer scripts minimal.
- Test new scripts for performance impact.
- Use `defer` or `async` attributes for script tags.
- Delay non-critical scripts using `setTimeout`.
- Load scripts conditionally.
- Use `preconnect` or `dns-prefetch` for required origins.

## Fonts Optimization
Fonts are crucial but can be optimized:
- Minimize the number of fonts.
- Upload fonts manually with `swap`.
- Preload fonts using code.

## Images Optimization
Images are often the heaviest assets. Optimize them by:
- Compressing images and using WebP format.
- Setting images below the first screen to lazy load.
- Avoiding images as backgrounds.
- Using SVGs where applicable.
- Embedding small SVGs directly.

## Video Optimization
Webflow's automatic video transcoding can reduce quality and increase file size. Prefer using:
- YouTube elements.
- Embedding YouTube/Vimeo iframes directly.

## Site Organization
Organize your site to enhance performance:
- Regularly clean up in the Style Manager.
- Set styles at the root level.
- Disable unused features.
- Preload critical links.
