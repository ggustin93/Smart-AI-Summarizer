# Top 8 Ways to Supercharge Webflow Site Performance

Enhance your Webflow site's performance with these proven strategies to ensure a fast, efficient, and user-friendly experience.

## 1. Avoid Third-Party Scripts
Third-party scripts, chatbots, and tracking scripts can significantly slow down your site. Prevent these scripts from loading immediately to improve initial load times.

## 2. Delay Scripts with Google Tag Manager
Use Google Tag Manager to manage and delay the loading of tags and scripts, optimizing your site's performance without compromising functionality.

## 3. Use Selective Loading on Mobile vs. Desktop
Load fewer scripts and effects on mobile versions of your site to improve speed, as Google ranks sites based on their mobile performance.

## 4. Optimize and Compress Images
Compress images using tools like Image Compressor and convert them to WebP format to reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality.

## 5. Lazy Load Images
Implement lazy loading to defer the loading of images until they are needed, improving initial page load times.

## 6. Use SVGs
SVG images are smaller and maintain high quality. Optimize and compress SVGs to further enhance performance.

## 7. Reduce or Remove Fonts
Limit the number of fonts and weights used on your site. Consider using system-UI fonts to eliminate additional server requests and improve load times.

## 8. Avoid Preloads
Preloading pages can slow down your site by loading multiple pages simultaneously. Disable preloading to maximize performance.

## Testing and Optimization Tools
Regularly test your site's performance using tools like Pingdom, PageSpeed Insights, Web.dev, and GTmetrix to ensure continuous optimization.

By implementing these strategies, you can maintain optimal performance for your Webflow site, providing a seamless user experience and improving your site's search engine rankings.
